# caesar

## Introduction
Cynthesis uses Machine Learning to generate a playlist that appeals to all members of a group based on audio features from the usersâ€™ top tracks.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/vincentmvdm/caesar.git
cd caesar
npm install
npm start
```
## TODO
- Enable 'multiplayer'
- Ensure that a song can not occur in a playlist more than once (we're fairly confident that Spotify already prevents this from happening)
